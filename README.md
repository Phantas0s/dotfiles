# dotfiles for Building Your Mouseless Development Environment

This is the dotfiles I use to test every month if my book, [Building Your Mouseless Development Environment](https://themoouseless.dev) is up to date.

They're part of the mouseless book companion too: https://github.com/Phantas0s/mouseless-book-companion/tree/master/part_II/13_mouseless_browsers/dotfiles
